# 🔐 Multimodal Biometric Authentication System (Fingerprint + ECG)

This project is a secure and intelligent multimodal biometric authentication system that verifies identity using *fingerprint images* and *ECG time-series signals*. By combining anatomical and physiological biometric traits, the system delivers stronger spoof-resistance and robust authentication compared to traditional single-modality systems.

It includes deep-learning-based feature extraction with *Vision Transformers (ViT)* for fingerprints and *Transformer encoders* for ECG signals, along with a *Flask-based real-time web interface* for user interaction.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🖐 *Fingerprint Recognition* using Vision Transformer (ViT)
- ❤ *ECG-based biometric authentication* using Time-Series Transformer
- 🔀 *Multimodal fusion* for final identity verification
- 🌐 *Flask web application* for real-time inference
- 🧠 *Deep learning with PyTorch*
- 🔐 *Highly secure & spoof-resistant*
- ⚡ *Real-time processing support*

## ⚙ Setup & Installation

###  Clone Repository**
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Multimodal-Biometric-System.git
cd Multimodal-Biometric-System

### Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run Application
- python app.py

### Then open browser:
http://localhost:5000

## 🌐 How It Works
- Upload a **fingerprint image** and **ECG (.dat + .hea)** file
- System preprocesses & extracts feature embeddings using deep learning
- Predictions from both modalities are fused using **score-level averaging**
- Final identity result & confidence value displayed in the browser

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Mobile-based biometric authentication application
- Support for additional modalities (**face / voice**)
- Edge-device deployment (**Jetson Nano / Raspberry Pi**)
- Federated or on-device learning for enhanced privacy
- Incremental user enrollment capability
- Blockchain-based identity management for secure storage
