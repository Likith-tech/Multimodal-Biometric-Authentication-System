# 🔐 Multimodal Biometric Authentication System (Fingerprint + ECG)

This project is a secure and intelligent multimodal biometric authentication system that verifies identity using **fingerprint images** and **ECG time-series signals**. By combining anatomical and physiological biometric traits, the system delivers stronger spoof-resistance and robust authentication compared to traditional single-modality systems.

It includes deep-learning-based feature extraction with **Vision Transformers (ViT)** for fingerprints and **Transformer encoders** for ECG signals, along with a **Flask-based real-time web interface** for user interaction.
